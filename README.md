# flutter_exam_for_pdax_azman
 This is my Flutter exam for PDAX, where I created an application using FakeAPI (https://fakerapi.it/en) to fetch and display data in a list or table. The exam showcases my skills in fetching API responses and implementing features such as page refresh, end-of-list detection, and data display.
